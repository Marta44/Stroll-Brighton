The aim of this project is to guide tourists but also locals at the discovery of Brighton and its hidden places. Its aim is also to promote walkings and outdoor activities after lock-down.

## Overview
This is an interactive front-end site that allows users to search for locations, activities and what to do in the city of Brighton UK. What makes this project different from many other websites is the possibility to address me enquires through a contact form and have a local tourist guide which can give you information and suggestions.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones) with the awareness that a mobile phone will be the main users choice to browse this website.

### Users of this site are looking for:
- A local personal guide who can give them advices and hints about Brighton.
- A website where they can find suggested locations but also discover their own favorite ones. 
## 1. Strategy
### The business goals of this website are:
- Showcase the main attractions of Brighton divided into four categories: art sites, pubs and restaurants, activities, curiosities.
- Be contacted by users and, as I studied art and I am passionate about it, guide them to visit cultural places and art sites in the city.

## 2. Scope
The scope of this project is to guide users at the discovery of the city of Brighton and keep them engaged using a map or getting in touch with me. 
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Usability.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.
- Design appeal that invoke the colours of the city of Brighton.
## 3. Structure
The contents and information are readable and not overwhelming. This approach considers that a user is walking in the city and needs an immediate answer to his/her questions. The users needs to visualize and assimilate immediately imagery, contents and the map. Contact is provided through a contact form or through my Github profile or Linkedin icons in the footer.
Social media icons in the footer are meant to be a way to join Brighton community groups or share pictures.

## 4. Skeleton
The website displays in an unique page divided into four sections. I created wireframes for every section:
- [Home page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [About page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [Explore page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [Booking page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
## 5. Surface
Colours:
For the sections I choose pastel colours which reminds the typical Brighton houses.
- Ford mint green: #CFFFE5 for the about section
- Light shade of orange: #FFE5CF for the explore section
- Light shade of yellow: #FFFDCF for the contact section
For the navigation bar and the footer I choose a White background as it is neutral and in contrast with the colorful sections.
- # 
Typography:
- For the Logo I used "Cabin Sketch" Google Font because is an artistic and dynamic font.
- For the contents I choose "Ganja Flower" Google Font because I have found it easy to read.
- For the Headings I choose ""...because....
Images:
The images have been shot by me (except for the home page photograph, credited in media) and selected to be eye-catching, interesting and engaging. 
The purpose of the images is to showcase the main locations of the city and encourage users to visit them.
