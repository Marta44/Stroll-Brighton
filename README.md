The aim of this project is to guide tourists but also locals at the discovery of Brighton and its hidden places. Its aim is also to promote walkings and outdoor activities after lock-down.

## Overview

> This is an interactive front-end site that allows users to search for locations, activities and what to do in the city of Brighton UK. What makes this project different from many other websites is the possibility to address me enquires through a contact form and have a local tourist guide which can give you information and suggestions.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones) with the awareness that a mobile phone will be the main users choice to browse this website.

## User Experience (UX)
### The target audience of this site is:
- A large demographic range of individuals both local and international tourists. The attractions displayed are heterogeneous to diversify the offer and please different age brackets.
### Users of this site are looking for:
- A local personal guide who can give them advices and hints about Brighton.
- A website where they can find suggested locations but also discover their own favorite ones. 
## 1. Strategy
### The business goals of this website are:
- Showcase the main attractions of Brighton divided into four categories: art sites, pubs and restaurants, activities, curiosities.
- Be contacted by users and, as I studied art and I am passionate about it, guide them to visit cultural places and art sites in the city.
### The customer goals are:
- Discover and walk to new places in Brighton reading Marta's favorites.
- Read some interesting contents and curiosities about the city.
- Have someone local who they can rely on and ask information.
- Be guided by a map but also be able to discover their own favorite places.
## 2. Scope
The scope of this project is to guide users at the discovery of the city of Brighton and keep them engaged using a map or getting in touch with me. 
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Usability.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.
- Design appeal that invoke the pastel colours of the city of Brighton.
## 3. Structure
The contents and information are readable and not overwhelming. This approach considers that a user is walking in the city and needs an immediate answer to his/her questions. The users needs to visualize and assimilate immediately imagery, contents and the map. Contact is provided through a contact form or through my Github profile or Linkedin icons in the footer.
Social media icons in the footer are meant to be a way to join Brighton community groups or share pictures.

## 4. Skeleton
The website displays in an unique page divided into four sections. I created wireframes for every section:
- [Home page wireframe]()
- [Explore page wireframe]()
- [Tips page wireframe]()
- [Booking page wireframe]()
## 5. Surface
Colours:
For the sections I choose pastel colours which reminds the typical Brighton houses.
I took inspiration from this palette: ![Pastel colors palette](/assets/images/UXcolors-palette.png "Pastel colors")
- Tutu: #fddfdf for the explore section
- Frosted Mint: #defde0 for the tips section
- Alice Blue: #def3fd for the booking section
For the navigation bar and the footer I choose a Whitesmoke background (#f5f5f5) as it is neutral and in contrast with the colorful sections.
For the navigation and footer links I used colors: orange, lightcoral, lightgreen and lightskyblue because provide enough visibility and readability.

Typography:
- For the Logo I used "Cabin Sketch" Google Font because is artistic and has the texture of a doodle.
- For the main text and contents I choose "Ganja Flower" Google Font because I have found it fancy and easy to read.
- For the Headings I choose "Annie Use Your Telescope" Google Font because seems an hand writing font and pairs with "Ganja Flower".
Images:
The images have been shot by me (except for the home page photograph, credited in media) and selected to be eye-catching, interesting and engaging. I choose this favorite icon because reminds the famous Brighton beach Huts. 
The purpose of the images is to showcase the main locations of the city and encourage users to visit them.

### Bugs and challenges during the project

## Deployment
I developed this project using Gitpod, an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
I have used the following commands throughout the project:
- git add . or filename (to add the changes and files to a staging area)
- git commit -m "" (to commit a message about the changes that have been brought)
- git push (to push the code to GitHub that host my repository)
- git checkout -b name of the branch (to switch and create at the same time a new branch to develop and test a specific Javascript function
- git status (to understand in which branch I was working)
- git checkout master (to switch again to the main branch)
- git merge name of the branch (to merge the secondary branch into the main one)
I deployed the project following these steps:
1. Log into GitHub
2. Selected my repository: Marta44/Stroll-Brighton
3. Clicked **Settings** on the navigation menu ![Settings](/assets/images/Settings-section.jpg "Settings Section")
4. Scrolled down to GitHub Pages section ![GitHub Pages](/assets/images/GitHubpages-deployed.png "GitHub Pages")
5. I selected the master branch in the publishing **Source** dropdown menu and pressed **Save**
6. The website has been published to GitHub Pages and the page refreshed automatically generating my site URL: [Live deployed page](https://marta44.github.io/Stroll-Brighton/)
7. The deployed site will update automatically If I bring changes with new commits.

How to run the code locally: 
1. Navigate to my project GitHub repository [Follow this link](https://github.com/Marta44/Stroll-Brighton)
2. Click **Code** dropdown menu and you have two options:
- Clone
- Download the ZIP file (allows you to extract the files on your local machine)
![Clone or download Repo](/assets/images/clone-downloadRepo.png "Clone or Download Repository")
3. Clone my repository copying and pasting into the terminal of your preferred editor/local IDE 'git clone https://github.com/Marta44/Stroll-Brighton.git'
4. Press Enter and a clone of this project will be created on your machine.
5. To remove all references to the remote repository type into your terminal: 'git remote rm origin' or 'git remote remove origin'. This deletes all references to the remote repository without removing the repository from the remote server.
6. When you clone this project to make Google Map loading on your local machine you have to generate a new API key following these steps [Generate an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and copy your API key into the script in your html file.
