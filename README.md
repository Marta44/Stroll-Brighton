# Stroll Brighton

![Postcard of Brighton](/assets/images/postcard-stroll-brighton.png "Brighton postcard")
The primary aim of this project is to create a website that provides information about selected venues and attractions in the Brighton area and also offers the services of a tourist guide. The secondary aim of the website is also to allow users to join a social media community in Brighton where they can meet people and share their pictures via Facebook or Instagram.
The project can be scalable and improved in the future adding events, festivals and concerts, which are the core of this vibrant city. [View the live project in GitHub Pages](https://marta44.github.io/Stroll-Brighton/)

## Overview

> This is an interactive front-end site that allows users to search for locations, activities and things to do in the city of Brighton (UK). What makes this project different from many other websites is the possibility to contact me with enquires regarding the creation of a personalized tour. The personalized tour can be one of three categories: art, nature or fun. They can also contact me if they need suggestions or information.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones) with the awareness that a mobile phone will be the main users choice to browse this website.

## User Experience (UX)

### The target audience of this website

- A large demographic range of individuals:
- non Brighton residents.
- local residents.
- international tourists.
- The attractions displayed are heterogeneous to diversify the offer and please different age brackets.

### Users of this site are looking for

- A personal guide to give them relevant suggestions and advices about Brighton.
- A website where they can search and find places using an interactive map.
- A website where they can find tips and suggestions about what to visit.

## 1. Strategy

### The business goals of this website

- Showcase the main attractions of Brighton divided into four categories: art sites, outdoor places(mainly parks), cafés and amusement parks.
- Provide in the tip section links to local businesses and attractions websites.
- Be contactable to users. Having studied art I wish to guide them to visit cultural places and art sites in the city.

### The customer goals

- Discover new places in Brighton using "My Tips" section.
- Read interesting content about the city.
- Be able to contact someone local (Marta) to ask for information.
- Be guided by a map but also be able to discover their own favorite places.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this project is to guide users at the discovery of the city of Brighton and keep them engaged using an interactive map or getting in touch with me. Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:

- Clarity.
- Usability.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.
- Appealing design that invokes the pastel colours of the city of Brighton.

## 3. Structure

The contents and information are readable and not overwhelming. This approach considers that a user is walking in the city and needs an immediate answer to his/her questions. The users needs to visualize and assimilate immediately imagery, contents and the map. Contact is provided through a contact form or through my Github profile or LinkedIn icons in the footer.
Social media icons in the footer are meant to be a way to join Brighton community groups or share pictures of the places discovered.

## 4. Skeleton

The website displays in an unique page divided into four sections. I created wireframes for every section:

- [Home page wireframe]()
- [Explore page wireframe]()
- [Tips page wireframe]()
- [Booking page wireframe]()

## 5. Surface

Colours scheme:
I have used pastel colours which are reminiscent of typical Brighton houses.
I took inspiration from this palette: ![Pastel colors palette](/assets/images/ux-colors-palette.png "Pastel colors")

- Tutu: #fddfdf for the explore section
- Frosted Mint: #defde0 for the tips section
- Alice Blue: #def3fd for the booking section
For the navigation bar and the footer I choose a Whitesmoke background (#f5f5f5) as it is neutral and in contrast with the colorful sections.
For the navigation and footer links: Orange, Lightcoral, Lightgreen and Lightskyblue because provide enough visibility and readability.

Typography:

- For the Logo I used "Cabin Sketch" Google Font because is artistic and has aesthetical appearance of a doodle.
- For the main text and contents I chose "Ganja Flower" Google Font because it is user friendly.
- For the headings I chose "Annie Use Your Telescope" Google Font because it is an hand writing font and pairs with "Ganja Flower".
Images:
All the images not taken by myself have been credited in "Media". They have been selected to be eye-catching, interesting and engaging. I chose the "favorite icon" because it is reminiscent of the famous Brighton beach huts.
The purpose of the images is to showcase the main locations of the city and encourage users to visit them.

### Bugs and challenges during the project

- EmailJS stopped working when I merged the owl carousel branch into the master branch. I rearranged the scripts in this order: jquery,  popper, bootstrap, google map, emailjs. As a result of this action the problem was fixed.
- For me has been a challenge to understand how to loop through the four types of places and I have to thank my Mentor Ignatius Ukwuoma to have shown me how to build sub-arrays into an array and loop through the results with a for each loop.

## Deployment

I developed this project using Gitpod, an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
I have used the following commands throughout the project:

- git add . or filename (to add the changes and files to a staging area)
- git commit -m "" (to commit a message about the changes that have been brought)
- git push (to push the code to GitHub that host my repository)
- git checkout -b name of the branch (to switch and create at the same time a new branch to develop and test a specific Javascript function
- git status (to understand in which branch I was working)
- git checkout master (to switch again to the main branch)
- git merge name of the branch (to merge the secondary branch into the main one)

I deployed the project following these steps:

1. Log into GitHub
2. Selected my repository: Marta44/Stroll-Brighton
3. Clicked **Settings** on the navigation menu ![Settings](/assets/images/settings-section.jpg "Settings Section")
4. Scrolled down to GitHub Pages section. Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab. Click on the link and it opens GitHub Pages:
![GitHub Pages](/assets/images/githubpages-deployed.png "GitHub Pages")
5. I selected the master branch in the publishing **Source** dropdown menu and pressed **Save**
6. The website has been published to GitHub Pages and the page refreshed automatically generating my site URL: [Live deployed page](https://marta44.github.io/Stroll-Brighton/)
7. The deployed site will update automatically If I bring changes with new commits.

How to run the code locally:

1. Navigate to my project GitHub repository [Follow this link](https://github.com/Marta44/Stroll-Brighton)

2. Click **Code** dropdown menu and you have two options:

- Clone
- Download the ZIP file (allows you to extract the files on your local machine)

![Clone or download Repo](/assets/images/clone-download-repo.png "Clone or Download Repository")
3. Clone my repository copying and pasting into the terminal of your preferred editor/local IDE 'git clone https://github.com/Marta44/Stroll-Brighton.git'.
4. Press Enter and a clone of this project will be created on your machine.
5. To remove all references to the remote repository type into your terminal: 'git remote rm origin' or 'git remote remove origin'. This deletes all references to the remote repository without removing the repository from the remote server.
6. When you clone this project to make Google Map loading on your local machine you have to generate a new API key following these steps [Generate an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and copy your API key into the script in your html file.
