## Overview
This is an interactive front-end site that allows users to search for locations, activities and what to do in the city of Brighton UK. What makes this project different from many other websites is the possibility to address me enquires through a contact form and have a local tourist guide which can give you information and suggestions.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones) with the awareness that a mobile phone will be the main users choice to browse this website.

### The business goals of this website are:

## 2. Scope
The scope of this project is to guide users at the discovery of the city of Brighton and keep them engaged using a map or getting in touch with me. 
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Usability.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.
- Design appeal.
## 3. Structure
The contents and information are readable and not overwhelming. This approach considers that a user is walking in the city and needs an immediate answer to his/her questions. The users needs to visualize and assimilate immediately imagery, contents and the map. Contact is provided through a contact form and social media icons in the footer.

## 4. Skeleton
The website displays in an unique page divided into four sections. I created wireframes for every section:
- [Home page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [About page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [Explore page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
- [Booking page wireframe](https://marta44.github.io/)
## 5. Surface
Colours:
For the main sections I choose pastel colours which reminds the typical Brighton houses.
- Ford mint green: #CFFFE5
- Light shade of orange: #FFE5CF
- Light shade of yellow: #FFFDCF
For the navigation bar and the footer I choose a White background as it is neutral and in contrast with the sections.
Typography:
- For the Logo I used Cabin Sketch Google Font.
- For the contents I choose Ganja Flower Google Font because I find it artistic and easy to read.
- For the Headings I choose ...because....
Images:
The images have been shot by me and selected to be eye-catching, interesting and engaging. The purpose of the images is to showcase the main locations of the city and encourage users to visit them.
